# Colossal-AI Tutorial Hands-on

## Introduction

Welcome to the [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) tutorial, which has been accepted as official tutorials by top conference [SC](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/), [AAAI](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-23/), [PPoPP](https://ppopp23.sigplan.org/), etc.


[Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI), a unified deep learning system for the big model era, integrates
many advanced technologies such as multi-dimensional tensor parallelism, sequence parallelism, heterogeneous memory management,
large-scale optimization, adaptive task scheduling, etc. By using Colossal-AI, we could help users to efficiently and
quickly deploy large AI model training and inference, reducing large AI model training budgets and scaling down the labor cost of learning and deployment.

## Discussion

Discussion about the [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) project is always welcomed! We would love to exchange ideas with the community to better help this project grow.
If you think there is a need to discuss anything, you may jump to our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/colossalaiworkspace/shared_invite/zt-z7b26eeb-CBp7jouvu~r0~lcFzX832w).

If you encounter any problem while running these tutorials, you may want to raise an [issue](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/issues/new/choose) in this repository.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup environment
You should use `conda` to create a virtual environment, we recommend **python 3.8**, e.g. `conda create -n colossal python=3.8`. This installation commands are for CUDA 11.3, if you have a different version of CUDA, please download PyTorch and Colossal-AI accordingly.

```
# install torch
# visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to download other versions
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113

# install latest ColossalAI
# visit https://colossalai.org/download to download corresponding version of Colossal-AI
pip install colossalai==0.1.11rc3+torch1.12cu11.3 -f https://release.colossalai.org
```

You can run `colossalai check -i` to verify if you have correctly set up your environment üïπÔ∏è.

If you encounter messages like `please install with cuda_ext`, do let me know as it could be a problem of the distribution wheel. üò•

Then clone the Colossal-AI repository from GitHub.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI.git
cd ColossalAI/examples/tutorial
```

## üî• Multi-dimensional Hybrid Parallel with Vision Transformer
1. Go to **hybrid_parallel** folder in the **tutorial** directory.
2. Install our model zoo.
```bash
pip install titans
```
3. Run with synthetic data which is of similar shape to CIFAR10 with the `-s` flag.
```bash
colossalai run --nproc_per_node 4 train.py --config config.py -s
```

4. Modify the config file to play with different types of tensor parallelism, for example, change tensor parallel size to be 4 and mode to be 2d and run on 8 GPUs.

## ‚òÄÔ∏è Sequence Parallel with BERT
1. Go to the **sequence_parallel** folder in the **tutorial** directory.
2. Run with the following command
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
colossalai run --nproc_per_node 4 train.py -s
```
3. The default config is sequence parallel size = 2, pipeline size = 1, let‚Äôs change pipeline size to be 2 and try it again.

## üìï Large batch optimization with LARS and LAMB
1. Go to the **large_batch_optimizer**  folder in the **tutorial** directory.
2. Run with synthetic data
```bash
colossalai run --nproc_per_node 4 train.py --config config.py -s
```

## üòÄ Auto-Parallel Tutorial
1. Go to the  **auto_parallel** folder in the **tutorial** directory.
2. Install `pulp` and `coin-or-cbc` for the solver.
```bash
pip install pulp
conda install -c conda-forge coin-or-cbc
```
2. Run the auto parallel resnet example with 4 GPUs with synthetic dataset.
```bash
colossalai run --nproc_per_node 4 auto_parallel_with_resnet.py -s
```

You should expect to the log like this. This log shows the edge cost on the computation graph as well as the sharding strategy for an operation. For example, `layer1_0_conv1 S01R = S01R X RR` means that the first dimension (batch) of the input and output is sharded while the weight is not sharded (S means sharded, R means replicated), simply equivalent to data parallel training.

## üéÜ Auto-Checkpoint Tutorial
1. Stay in the `auto_parallel` folder.
2. Install the dependencies.
```bash
pip install matplotlib transformers
```
3. Run a simple resnet50 benchmark to automatically checkpoint the model.
```bash
python auto_ckpt_solver_test.py --model resnet50
```

You should expect the log to be like this
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcaitech/public_assets/main/examples/tutorial/auto-ckpt%20demo.png)

This shows that given different memory budgets, the model is automatically injected with activation checkpoint and its time taken per iteration. You can run this benchmark for GPT as well but it can much longer since the model is larger.
```bash
python auto_ckpt_solver_test.py --model gpt2
```

4. Run a simple benchmark to find the optimal batch size for checkpointed model.
```bash
python auto_ckpt_batchsize_test.py
```

You can expect the log to be like

## üöÄ Run OPT finetuning and inference
1. Install the dependency
```bash
pip install datasets accelerate
```
2. Run finetuning with synthetic datasets with one GPU
```bash
bash ./run_clm_synthetic.sh
```
3. Run finetuning with 4 GPUs
```bash
bash ./run_clm_synthetic.sh 16 0 125m 4
```
4. Run inference with OPT 125M
```bash
docker hpcaitech/tutorial:opt-inference
docker run -it --rm --gpus all --ipc host -p 7070:7070 hpcaitech/tutorial:opt-inference
```
5. Start the http server inside the docker container with tensor parallel size 2
```bash
python opt_fastapi.py opt-125m --tp 2 --checkpoint /data/opt-125m
```
