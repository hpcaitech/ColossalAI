# Colossal-AI Tutorial Hands-on

## Introduction

Welcome to the [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) tutorial, which has been accepted as official tutorials by top conference [SC](https://sc22.supercomputing.org/), [AAAI](https://aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI-23/), [PPoPP](https://ppopp23.sigplan.org/), etc.


[Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI), a unified deep learning system for the big model era, integrates
many advanced technologies such as multi-dimensional tensor parallelism, sequence parallelism, heterogeneous memory management,
large-scale optimization, adaptive task scheduling, etc. By using Colossal-AI, we could help users to efficiently and
quickly deploy large AI model training and inference, reducing large AI model training budgets and scaling down the labor cost of learning and deployment.

## Prerequisite

To run this example, you only need to have PyTorch and Colossal-AI installed. A sample script to download the dependencies is given below.

```
# install torch 1.12 with CUDA 11.3
# visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to download other versions
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113

# install latest ColossalAI
# visit https://colossalai.org/download to download corresponding version of Colossal-AI
pip install colossalai==0.1.11+torch1.12cu11.3 -f https://release.colossalai.org
```

## Prepare Common Dataset

**This tutorial folder aims to let the user to quickly try out the training scripts**. One major task for deep learning is data preparataion. To save time on data preparation, we use `CIFAR10` for most tutorials and synthetic datasets if the dataset required is too large. To make the `CIFAR10` dataset shared across the different examples, it should be downloaded in tutorial root directory with the following command.

```python
python download_cifar10.py
```
