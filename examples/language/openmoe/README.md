## OpenMoE
[OpenMoE](https://github.com/XueFuzhao/OpenMoE) is a project aimed at Igniting the Open-Source MoE Community!

The following example of [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) demonstrates finetune and inference methods.


## Our Modifications

We reimplement OpenMoE with PyTorch + GPU.

## Run Inference

By running the following script:
```bash
bash infer.sh
```
You will infer a [OpenMoE-8B/32E](https://github.com/XueFuzhao/OpenMoE) model.
