# Stable Diffusion with Colossal-AI
*[Colosssal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) provides a faster and lower cost solution for pretraining and
fine-tuning for AIGC (AI-Generated Content) applications such as the model [stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) from [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/).*

We take advantage of [Colosssal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI) to exploit multiple optimization strategies
, e.g. data parallelism, tensor parallelism, mixed precision & ZeRO, to scale the training to multiple GPUs.

## Stable Diffusion
[Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion) is a latent text-to-image diffusion
model.
Thanks to a generous compute donation from [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and support from [LAION](https://laion.ai/), we were able to train a Latent Diffusion Model on 512x512 images from a subset of the [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) database.
Similar to Google's [Imagen](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11487),
this model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts.

[Stable Diffusion with Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/main/examples/images/diffusion) provides **6.5x faster training and pretraining cost saving, the hardware cost of fine-tuning can be almost 7X cheaper** (from RTX3090/4090 24GB to RTX3050/2070 8GB).

## Requirements
A suitable [conda](https://conda.io/) environment named `ldm` can be created
and activated with:

```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ldm
```

You can also update an existing [latent diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion) environment by running

```
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
pip install transformers==4.19.2 diffusers invisible-watermark
pip install -e .
```

### Install [Colossal-AI v0.1.10](https://colossalai.org/download/) From Our Official Website
```
pip install colossalai==0.1.10+torch1.11cu11.3 -f https://release.colossalai.org
```

### Install [Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning)
We use the Sep. 2022 version with commit id as `b04a7aa`.
```
git clone https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning && cd lightning && git reset --hard b04a7aa
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install .
```

> The specified version is due to the interface incompatibility caused by the latest update of [Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning), which will be fixed in the near future.

## Dataset
The DataSet is from [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/), the subset of [LAION](https://laion.ai/),
you should the change the `data.file_path` in the `config/train_colossalai.yaml`

## Training

we provide the script `train.sh` to run the training task , and three Stategy in `configs`:`train_colossalai.yaml`, `train_ddp.yaml`, `train_deepspeed.yaml`

for example, you can run the training from colossalai by
```
python main.py --logdir /tmp -t --postfix test -b config/train_colossalai.yaml
```

- you can change the `--logdir` the save the log information and the last checkpoint

### Training config
you can change the trainging config in the yaml file

- accelerator: acceleratortype, default 'gpu'
- devices: device number used for training, default 4
- max_epochs: max training epochs
- precision: usefp16 for training or not, default 16, you must use fp16 if you want to apply colossalai


## Comments

- Our codebase for the diffusion models builds heavily on [OpenAI's ADM codebase](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion)
, [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch),
[Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion), [Lightning](https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion).
Thanks for open-sourcing!

- The implementation of the transformer encoder is from [x-transformers](https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers) by [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains?tab=repositories).

- The implementation of [flash attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention) is from [HazyResearch](https://github.com/HazyResearch).
