## Overview
[ColossalEval](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/main/applications/ColossalEval) is a project which provides a uniform pipeline to help evaluate language models on different public dataset or your own dataset using both classic metrics and the help from GPTs. More details can be found in the following sections.

## Leaderboard

We conducted comprehensive evaluation on 4 dataset and compare our Colossal-Llama-2-7b-base model with various models.

- We use 5-shot for MMLU and calculate scores based on the logits of first predicted token.
- We use 5-shot for CMMLU and calculate scores based on the logits of first predicted token.
- We use 5-shot for AGIEval and only calculate scores for 4-choice questions using a combination metric of exact match and the logits of first predicted token. If any of the exact match or logits of first predicted token is correct, the model will get the score.
- We use 0-shot for GAOKAO-Bench and only calculate scores for 4-choice questions based on the logits of first predicted token.
- The generation config for all dataset is greedy search.
- We also provided CEval scores from its lastest leaderboard or the official repository of the model.

Our model achieves a much better score over all other Llama-1 or Llama-2 based models and also stands out among popular open source LLMs.

## Install
You should install `ColossalEval` in order to use it and `colossal_eval` is the package installed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI.git
cd ColossalAI/applications/ColossalEval
pip install .
```
If you want to add customized dataset or models, use `pip install -e .` in stead to ensure that any changes you make to the source code will immediately affect the package you install.

## Evaluation Process
The evaluation process involves 2 steps which are `inference` and `evaluation`. You need to set the config for each step.

### Inference

The inference process consists of two parts.
1. Preprocess and convert the original dataset.
2. Config your tokenizer and model arguments to perform zero-shot or few-shot prompting.

#### Dataset Preparation

In this step, the original dataset(either in `csv` or `jsonl` format) will be loaded and converted into a `dict`. In the conversion process, we carefully parse each subcategory and assign specific inference arguments for this subcategory.

Inference arguments are stored in a `dict`. The following is an example.

```python
inference_kwargs = {
    "calculate_loss": True,
    "all_classes": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "language": "Chinese",
    "pretrain": False,
    "max_new_tokens": 32
}
```
The `inference_kwargs` currently contains 5 fields:

- `calculate_loss` (bool, compulsory): Whether the loss on target tokens will be calculated
- `all_classes` (Optional[list], compulsory): Whether the subcategory is a single-choice question. Specify all available options in a list or otherwise None.
- `language` (str, compulsory): The language for the subcategory.
- `pretrain` (bool, compulsory): Whether the dataset is a pretrain dataset or not. It is usually used for calculate perplexity when you want to evaluate a model with extended context length.
- `max_new_tokens` (int, compulsory): The number of new tokens to generate during inference.

For example, for dataset MMLU, each subcategory consists of single-choice questions with options A, B, C and D by default and we can assign value `["A", "B", "C", "D"]` to key`all_classes`. For dataset C-Eval, target answers aren't provided in the test split so `calculate_loss` should be set as False. However, other dataset such as GAOKAO-bench contains different formats of questions and lacks some keys or metadata which can reveal what type (single-choice or multi-choice) of questions it is. Before assigning inference arguments, we first parse the dataset to decide which type of questions the subcategory belongs to and set the inference arguments accordingly.

Other than `inference_kwargs`, `data` is a list containing questions of a same subcategory. The following is a converted dataset.

```json
{
    "dev": {
        "category 1": {"data": [], "inference_kwargs": {}},
        "category 2": {"data": [], "inference_kwargs": {}}
    },
    "test": {
        "category 1": {"data": [], "inference_kwargs": {}},
        "category 2": {"data": [], "inference_kwargs": {}}
    }
}
```

A data sample basically follow the format of Alpaca. It should contain the following keys:

* `dataset` (str, compulsory): The name of the dataset.
* `split` (str, compulsory): The split of the instruction.
* `catrgory` (str, compulsory): The category of the instruction.
* `instruction` (str, compulsory): The instruction for the LLM.
* `input` (str, optional): The additional context of the instruction.
* `output` (str, optional): The model output of the instruction.
* `target` (str, optional): The target answer for the instruction.

Example:

```json
{
    "dev": {
        "Abstract Algebra": [
            {
                "dataset": "mmlu",
                "split": "dev",
                "category": "Abstract Algebra",
                "instruction": "The following is a single-choice question on Abstract Algebra. Answer the question by replying A, B, C or D.",
                "input": "Question: Find all c in Z_3 such that Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field.\nA. 0\nB. 1\nC. 2\nD. 3\nAnswer: ",
                "output": "",
                "target": "B"
            },
        ]
    },
    "test": {
        "Abstract Algebra": [
            {
                "dataset": "mmlu",
                "split": "test",
                "category": "Abstract Algebra",
                "instruction": "The following is a single-choice question on Abstract Algebra. Answer the question by replying A, B, C or D.",
                "input": "Question: Find the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.\nA. 0\nB. 4\nC. 2\nD. 6\nAnswer: ",
                "output": "",
                "target": "B"
            },
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Configuration
In this step, you will configure your tokenizer and model arguments to infer on the given datasets.

A config file consists of two parts.
1. Model config. In model config, you need to specify model name, model path, model class, tokenizer arguments and model arguments. For model class, currently we support `HuggingFaceModel`, `HuggingFaceCausalLM`, `ChatGLMModel` and `ChatGLMModel2`. `HuggingFaceModel` is for models that can be loaded with `AutoModel` and `HuggingFaceCausalLM` is for models that can be loaded with `AutoModelForCausalLM`. `ChatGLMModel` and `ChatGLMModel2` are for ChatGLM and ChatGLM2 models respectively. You can check all model classes in `colossal_eval/models/__init__.py`. If your model should set `trust_remote_code` as true, specify it in the `tokenizer_kwargs` and `model_kwargs` fields.
2. Dataset config. In dataset config, you need to specify dataset name, path and dataset class. Currently, we support zero-shot on dataset MMLU, CMMLU, AGIEval, GAOKAO-Bench and LongBench and few-shot on dataset MMLU, CMMLU and AGIEval. If you want to enable few shot, set `few_shot` as true. You can check all model classes in `colossal_eval/dataset/__init__.py`.

Once you have all config ready, the program will run inference on all the given datasets on all the given models.

An example config using model class `HuggingFaceCausalLM` and dataset class `CMMLUDataset` can be:
```json
{
    "model": [
        {
            "name": "model name",
            "model_class": "HuggingFaceCausalLM",
            "parameters": {
                "path": "path to model",
                "model_max_length": 2048,
                "tokenizer_path": "path to tokenizer",
                "tokenizer_kwargs": {
                    "use_fast": false,
                    "trust_remote_code": true
                },
                "peft_path": null,
                "model_kwargs": {
                    "trust_remote_code": true
                },
                "prompt_template": "plain",
                "batch_size": 4
            }
        }
    ],
    "dataset": [
        {
            "name": "dataset name",
            "dataset_class": "CMMLUDataset",
            "debug": false,
            "few_shot": true,
            "path": "path to original dataset",
            "save_path": "path to save converted dataset"
        }
    ]
}
```

Currently, we support Hugging Face models. The `tokenizer_kwargs` is the arguments used in `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained()`. The `model_kwargs` is the arguments used in `AutoModel.from_pretrained` or `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained()`. `few_shot` will be set true if you want to enable few-shot prompting for the dataset. `debug` will be set true if you want to verify whether your prompt is right or wrong.

#### How to Use
An example script can be the following. The `configs/dataset_evaluation/inference.py` is the same in all examples provided.

```shell
torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 inference.py \
    --config "path to config file" \
    --load_dataset \
    --inference_save_path "path to save inference results"
```

You should specify the path to config file in `config`. You can run the script without specifying `load_dataset` if you already save the converted dataset or otherwise set it to first load the original dataset and save the converted dataset. You should specify the path to save inference results in `inference_save_path`.

### Evaluation

In the evaluation process, you only need to configure your evaluation parameters. You can use either public dataset or help from GPTs to do evaluation. We will introduce configuration for dataset evaluation and GPT evaluation.

#### Dataset Evaluation

In dataset evaluation, we calculate different metrics on the given inference results and public dataset.

##### Configuration

A config file for dataset evaluation consists of two parts.
1. Model config. In model config, you need to specify model name. If you want to evaluate perplexity over a pretrain dataset and calculate per-byte-perplexity, you have to add your tokenizer config and model max length.
2. Dataset config. In dataset config, you need to specify the evaluation metrics for the dataset.

Once you have all config ready, the program will run evaluation on inference results for all given models and dataset.

An example config can be:
```json
{
    "model": [
        {
            "name": "model name"
        }
    ],
    "dataset": [
        {
            "name": "dataset name",
            "metrics": ["first_token_accuracy"]
        }
    ]
}
```

The above config specifies that the program will evaluate the inference results using `first_token_accuracy` metric.

##### How to Use

An example script can be the following.

```shell
python eval_dataset.py \
    --config "path to config file" \
    --inference_results_path "path to inference results" \
    --evaluation_results_save_path "path to save evaluation results"
```

You should specify the path to config file in `config`, the path to inference results in `inference_results_path` and the path to save evaluation results in `evaluation_save_path`.

#### GPT Evaluation

In GPT evaluation, we provide a prompt template which can fit in different pre-defined metrics with Chain-of-Thoughts. In the following sections, we will only introduce how you can evaluate model answers using GPTs. More details can be found in `colossal_eval/evaluate/GPT Evaluation.md`.

##### Configuration

The following is an example of a English config file. The configuration file can control how the pipeline evaluates the model. You need to specify GPT evaluation metrics. You can find an example English config file in `configs/gpt_evaluation`.

```json
{
    "language": "en",
    "category": {
        "brainstorming": {
            "GPT": [
                "language organization",
                "relevance",
                "creativity",
                "practicality",
                "reasonableness"
            ]
        },
    }
}
```

##### How to Use
After setting the config file, you can evaluate the model using `examples/gpt_evaluation/eval.py`. If you want to make comparisons between answers of two different models, you should specify two answer files in the argument `answer_file_list` and two model names in the argument `model_name_list`(details can be found in `colossal_eval/evaluate/GPT Evaluation.md`). If you want to evaluate one answer file, the length of both `answer_file_list` and `model_name_list` should be 1 and the program will perform evaluation using GPTs. The prompt files for battle and gpt evaluation can be found in `configs/gpt_evaluation/prompt`. `target file` is the path to the converted dataset you save during inference time.

An example script is provided as follows:

```shell
python eval.py \
    --config_file "path to the config file" \
    --battle_prompt_file "path to the prompt file for battle" \
    --gpt_evaluation_prompt_file "path to the prompt file for gpt evaluation" \
    --target_file "path to the target answer file" \
    --answer_file_list "path to the answer file" \
    --model_name_list "the names of the model" \
    --gpt_model "which GPT model to use for evaluation" \
    --save_path "path to save results" \
    --openai_key "your openai key" \
```

## More Details

### Inference

In the inference process, we will do generation, calculate loss over target tokens, calculate number of target tokens, softmax over given options (for example, "A", "B", "C", and "D") according to the inference arguments.

For tokenization, we adopt tokenization strategy in [LongBench](https://github.com/THUDM/LongBench/blob/main/pred.py#L55) to preserve crucial instructions on the left and right side and keep all target tokens.

For labeling target tokens, we adopt method from [FastChat](https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/train/train.py#L137), but it doesn't always hold true due to tokenizers' different behavior. We plan to insert special tokens to correctly label the target tokens.

For calculating loss, we return per-sample-loss instead of per-batch-loss if we directly use `model(batch).loss` provided in HuggingFace.

### Evaluation

To make it more easier to set the config, you only need to specify all metrics you want to use in key `metrics`. However, the program will only use a subset of metrics you give for different subcategories. Applying all metrics to all subcategories is obviously unsuitable. The suggested metrics for specific categories should be defined in `colossal_eval/evaluate/dataset_evaluator/metrics.py`.

#### Metrics

- `combined_single_choice_accuracy`: A combination of `first_token_logit` and `single_choice_accuracy`. If one of these is correct, the model will get the score. It can be used in all dataset that contains single-choice questions.
- `first_token_logit`: Calculate score based on softmax score over the given choices. If the argmax of the softmax is equal to the reference, the model will get the score. If there is `NaN` in softmax score, it will calculate the score using exact match. It can be used in all dataset that contains single-choice questions.
- `single_choice_accuracy`: Calculate score using exact match. It will only get the first uppercase letter such as A, B, C or D that is not surrouded by lowercase letters.

## FAQ

### How to Add a New Metric?

If you want to add a customized metric, we recommend using `pip install -e .` to ensure that any changes you make to the source code will immediately affect the package you install.

To add a new metric, you can follow the example of multi_choice_accuracy in line 339 in `colossal_eval/evaluate/dataset_evaluator/metric.py`. The method take one data sample's prediction and reference as input and return a score ranging from 0 to 1.

A skeleton of code is the following.

```python

def CustomizedMetric(prediction: str, reference: str):
	score = xxx
	return score
```

Once you have successfully added your own metric, you should specify your metric both in `colossal_eval/evaluate/dataset_evaluator/metric.py` (suggest which subcategories shoule the metric be applied to) and your evaluation config.

### How to Add a New Dataset?

If you want to add customized dataset, we recommend using `pip install -e .` to ensure that any changes you make to the source code will immediately affect the package you install.

To add a new dataset, you can follow the example of `colossal_eval/dataset/mmlu.py`. You need to make sure that the format of questions in one subcategory should be the same. For example, all questions should have target answers or all questions should be single-choice questions.

A skeleton of code is the following.

```python

class CustomizedDataset(BaseDataset):
    @staticmethod
    def load():
        # 1. Load and convert the original dataset format.
    	# 2. Assign inference arguments for each subcategory.
    	# 3. Return the converted dataset.
    	pass
```

Once you have successfully added your own dataset, you can specify your dataset class in your inference config.

### How to Add a New Model?

If you want to add customized models, we recommend using `pip install -e .` to ensure that any changes you make to the source code will immediately affect the package you install.

To add a new model, you can follow the example of `colossal_eval/models/huggingface.py`. You need to provide a way to load the model and tokenizer, calculate loss and generate.

A skeleton of code is the following.

```python

class CustomizedModel(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
		self._load_tokenizer()
		self._load_model()

	def _load_tokenizer():
		pass

	def _load_model():
		pass

	def _calculate_loss():
		pass

	def get_loss():
		self._calculate_loss()

	def inference(samples):
		# 1. Load samples from the same subcategory.
		# 2. Infer in a batch way according to inference arguments.
		# 3. Return results.
		batch_samples = xxx
		self.get_loss(batch_samples)
		self.generate(batch_samples)

		return inference_results

	def generate():
		pass
```

Once you have successfully added your own model, you can specify your model class in your inference config.

## To do
