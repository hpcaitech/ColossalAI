who is the first president of the USA? [/INST] The first president of the United States was George Washington. </s><s>[INST] tell me a story [/INST] One story that might be interesting is the story of how the United States was founded.  In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies united together to form the new nation of America.  The first president of the new nation was George Washington.  The first state was Pennsylvania.  The first capital was Philadelphia.  The first presidential election was held in 1787, and was between George Read, a Federalist, and John Adams, a Republican.  The Federalists wanted to keep the power of the federal government limited, while the Republicans wanted the power to be spread around to the states.  The Federalists won, and George Washington was elected president. </s>
