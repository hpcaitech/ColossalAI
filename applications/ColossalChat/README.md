## What is ColossalChat?

[ColossalChat](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/main/applications/ColossalChat) is a project to implement LLM with RLHF, powered by the [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI).

Coati stands for `ColossalAI Talking Intelligence`. It is the name for the module implemented in this project and is also the name of the large language model developed by the ColossalChat project.

The Coati package provides a unified large language model framework that has implemented the following functions

- Supports comprehensive large-model training acceleration capabilities for ColossalAI, without requiring knowledge of complex distributed training algorithms
- Supervised datasets collection
- Supervised instructions fine-tuning
- Training reward model
- Reinforcement learning with human feedback
- Perfectly integrated with the Hugging Face ecosystem, a high degree of model customization

## Introduction

### RLHF Training Stage1 - Supervised Instructs Tuning

Stage1 is supervised instructs fine-tuning (SFT). This step is a crucial part of the RLHF training process, as it involves training a machine learning model using human-provided instructions to learn the initial behavior for the task at hand. More details can be found in [example guideline](./examples/README.md).

### RLHF Training Stage2 - Training Reward Model

Stage2 trains a reward model, which obtains corresponding scores by manually ranking different outputs for the same prompt and supervises the training of the reward model.

### RLHF Training Stage3 - Proximal Policy Optimization

In stage3 we will use reinforcement learning algorithm--- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which is the most complex part of the training process:

</p>


### Alternative Option For RLHF: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
For those seeking an alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) presents a compelling option. DPO, as detailed in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290), DPO offers an low-cost way to perform RLHF and usually request less computation resources compares to PPO. Read this [README](./examples/README.md) for more information.

### Alternative Option For RLHF: Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO)
Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14734) is similar to DPO but it abandons the use of the reference model, which makes the training more efficient. It also adds a reward shaping term called target reward margin to enhance training stability. It also use length normalization to better align with the inference process. Read this [README](./examples/README.md) for more information.

### Alternative Option For RLHF: Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO)
Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07691) is a reference model free alignment method that use a mixture of SFT loss and a reinforcement leanring loss calculated based on odds-ratio-based implicit reward to makes the training more efficient and stable. Read this [README](./examples/README.md) for more information.

### Alternative Option For RLHF: Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO)
We support the method introduced in the paper [KTO:Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.01306) (KTO). Which is a aligment method that directly maximize "human utility" of generation results. Read this [README](./examples/README.md) for more information.

### Alternative Option For RLHF: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
We support the main algorithm used to train DeepSeek R1 model, a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), that enhances mathematical reasoning abilities while concurrently optimizing the memory usage of PPO. Read this [README](./examples/README.md) for more information.

### SFT for DeepSeek V3
We support fine-tuning DeepSeek V3/R1 model with LoRA. Read this [README](./examples/README.md) for more information.

### Inference Quantization and Serving - After Training

We provide an online inference server and a benchmark. We aim to run inference on single GPU, so quantization is essential when using large models.

We support 8-bit quantization (RTN), 4-bit quantization (GPTQ), and FP16 inference.

Online inference server scripts can help you deploy your own services.
For more details, see [`inference/`](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/main/applications/Chat/inference).
