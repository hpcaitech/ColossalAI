## What is Coati ?

Coati is a large language model developed by Colossal-AI, which is also a unified large language model framework that has implemented the following functions
- Supports comprehensive large-model training acceleration capabilities for ColossalAI, without requiring knowledge of complex distributed training algorithms
- Supervised datasets collection
- Supervised insturcts fine-tuning
- Training reward model
- Reinforcement learning with human feedback
- Quantization inference
- Fast model deploying
- Perfectly integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem, high degree of model customization


More details can be found in the [blog](https://www.hpc-ai.tech/blog/colossal-ai-chatgpt).

## Online demo
You can experience the performance of Coati7B on this page.

[chat.colossalai.org](https://chat.colossalai.org/)

> Warning: Due to model and dataset size limitations, Coati is just a baby model, Coati7B may output incorrect information and lack the ability for multi-turn dialogue. There is still significant room for improvement.
## Install

### Install the environment

```shell
conda creat -n coati
conda activate coati
pip install .
```

### Install the Transformers
Given Hugging Face hasn't officially supported the LLaMA models, We fork a branch of Transformers that can be compatible with our code

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hpcaitech/transformers
cd transformers
pip install .
```

## How to use?

### Supervised datasets collection

we colllected 104K bilingual dataset of Chinese and English, and you can find the datasets in this repo

Here is how we collected the data
<p align="center">
<img src="assets/data-collect.png" width=500/>
</p>

### Stage1 - Supervised instructs tuning

Stage1 is supervised instructs fine-tuning, which uses the datasets mentioned earlier to fine-tune the model

you can run the `examples/train_sft.sh` to start a supervised instructs fine-tuning

```
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train_sft.py \
    --pretrain "/path/to/LLaMa-7B/" \
    --model 'llama' \
    --strategy colossalai_zero2 \
    --log_interval 10 \
    --save_path  /path/to/Coati-7B \
    --dataset /path/to/data.json \
    --batch_size 4 \
    --accimulation_steps 8 \
    --lr 2e-5 \
    --max_datasets_size 512 \
    --max_epochs 1 \
```

### Stage2 - Training reward model

Stage2 trains a reward model, which obtains corresponding scores by manually ranking different outputs for the same prompt and supervises the training of the reward model

you can run the `examples/train_rm.sh` to start a reward model training

```
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train_reward_model.py
    --pretrain "/path/to/LLaMa-7B/" \
    --model 'llama' \
    --strategy colossalai_zero2 \
    --loss_fn 'log_exp'\
    --save_path 'rmstatic.pt' \
```

### Stage3 - Training model with reinforcement learning by human feedback

Stage3 uses reinforcement learning algorithm, which is the most complex part of the training process:

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/stage-3.jpeg" width=500/>
</p>

you can run the `examples/train_prompts.sh` to start training PPO with human feedback

```
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=4 train_prompts.py prompts.csv \
  --pretrain "/path/to/LLaMa-7B/" \
  --model 'llama' \
  --strategy colossalai_zero2
```


For more details, see `examples/`.

We also support training reward model with true-world data. See `examples/train_reward_model.py`.

### How to save/load checkpoint

We have integrated the Transformers save and load pipeline, allowing users to freely call Hugging Face's language models and save them in the HF format.

```
from coati.models.llama import LlamaLM
from coati.trainer import SFTTrainer

model = LlamaLM(pretrained=args.pretrain)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(args.pretrain)

trainer = SFTTrainer(model=model,
    strategy=strategy,
    optim=optim,
    train_dataloader=train_dataloader,
    eval_dataloader=eval_dataloader,
    batch_size=args.batch_size,
    max_epochs=args.max_epochs,
    accimulation_steps = args.accimulation_steps
)

trainer.fit()
trainer.save_model(path=args.save_path, only_rank0=True, tokenizer=tokenizer)
```

## The Plan

- [x] implement PPO fine-tuning
- [x] implement training reward model
- [x] support LoRA
- [x] support inference
- [x] open source the reward model weight
- [x] support llama from [facebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)
- [x] implement PPO-ptx fine-tuning
- [ ] integrate with Ray
- [ ] support more RL paradigms, like Implicit Language Q-Learning (ILQL),
- [ ] support chain of throught by [langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)
