    Chunk a list of blocks and run each chunk with activation
    checkpointing. We define a "block" as a callable whose only inputs are
    the outputs of the previous block.

    Implements Subsection 1.11.8

    Args:
        blocks:
            List of blocks
        args:
            Tuple of arguments for the first block.
        blocks_per_ckpt:
            Size of each chunk. A higher value corresponds to fewer 
            checkpoints, and trades memory for speed. If None, no checkpointing 
            is performed.
