colossalai.nn
=============

*This part contains different colossalai layers for constructing your model.
You can easily use them as the way of using layers in torch.nn.*

*Now colossalai support layer types below:* ``Linear``, ``Classifier``, ``Embedding``,
``PatchEmbedding``, ``LayerNorm``, ``Dropout`` *for different parallelisms.*
