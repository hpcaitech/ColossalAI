        cu_seqlens_k: (batch_size + 1,), dtype torch.int32. The cumulative sequence lengths
           of the sequences in the batch, used to index into kv.
        max_seqlen_q: int. Maximum query sequence length in the batch.
        max_seqlen_k: int. Maximum key sequence length in the batch.
        dropout_p: float. Dropout probability.
        softmax_scale: float. The scaling of QK^T before applying softmax.
            Default to 1 / sqrt(headdim).
        causal: bool. Whether to apply causal attention mask (e.g., for auto-regressive modeling).
        return_attn_probs: bool. Whether to return the attention probabilities. This option is for
           testing only. The returned probabilities are not guaranteed to be correct
           (they might not have the right scaling).
    Return:
        out: (total, nheads, headdim).
        softmax_lse [optional, if return_attn_probs=True]: (batch_size, nheads, seqlen). The
            logsumexp of each row of the matrix QK^T * scaling (e.g., log of the softmax
            normalization factor).
        S_dmask [optional, if return_attn_probs=True]: (batch_size, nheads, seqlen, seqlen).
            The output of softmax (possibly with different scaling). It also encodes the dropout
            pattern (negative means that location was dropped, nonnegative means it was kept).
