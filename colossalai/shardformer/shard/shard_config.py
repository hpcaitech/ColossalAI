    The config for sharding the huggingface model

    Args:
        tensor_parallel_process_group (Optional[ProcessGroup]): The process group of tensor parallelism, it's necessary when using tensor parallel. Defaults to None, which is the global process group.
        pipeline_stage_manager (Optional[PipelineStageManager]): If using pipeline parallelism, it's necessary to specify a pipeline stage manager for inter-process communication in pipeline parallelism. Defaults to None, which means not using pipeline parallelism.
        enable_tensor_parallelism (bool): Whether to use tensor parallelism. Defaults to True.
        enable_fused_normalization (bool): Whether to use fused layernorm. Defaults to False.
        enable_flash_attention (bool, optional): Whether to switch on flash attention. Defaults to False.
        enable_jit_fused (bool, optional): Whether to switch on JIT fused operators. Defaults to False.
        enable_sequence_parallelism (bool): Whether to turn on sequence parallelism, which partitions non-tensor-parallel regions along the sequence dimension. Defaults to False.
        enable_sequence_overlap (bool): Whether to turn on sequence overlap, wheich overlap the computation and communication in sequence parallelism. It can only be used when enable_sequence_parallelism is True. Defaults to False.
        enable_all_optimization (bool): Whether to turn on all optimization tools including 'fused normalizaion', 'flash attention', 'JIT fused operators', 'sequence parallelism' and 'sequence overlap'. Defaults to False.
        inference_only (bool): Whether only doing forward passing. Defaults to False.
